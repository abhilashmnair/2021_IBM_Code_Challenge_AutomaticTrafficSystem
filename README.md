# Automatic Traffic System

An automated traffic signalling system that provides a smart way of defining the flow of vehicles in traffic.

## The Problem We Face

We all have experienced long queues and waiting time in traffic, haven't us? Even though there may be a few vehicles (or none at all!), we need to wait for the timer to end to continue our journey. Isn't it a wastage of our valuable time and also resources?

## How can we solve this?

We came up with a solution for this. An automated, smart traffic signalling system, which is capable of analysing the traffic beforehand and providing signalling according to the congestion. Each traffic signals and/or junctions have cameras which captures images a particular direction and sends to a backend server where the image is processed and an optimum time limit is returned.

## System Users and Usecase

This is as an embedded system. The software and required hardware are integrated together to perform the specific task. Hence maintainance and activation is only the key external activities that is needed to be performed in the system. System analysts, system maintainers, and various authorities like traffic control have access to the system for reviewing and retrieval of various information.
