# Automatic Traffic System

An automated traffic signalling system that provides a smart way of defining the flow of vehicles in traffic.

### The Problem We Face

We all have experienced long queues and waiting time in traffic, haven't us? Even though there may be a few vehicles (or none at all!), we need to wait for the timer to end to continue our journey. Isn't it a wastage of our valuable time and also resources?

### How can we solve this?

We came up with a solution for this. An automated, smart traffic signalling system, which is capable of analysing the traffic beforehand and providing signalling according to the congestion. Each traffic signals and/or junctions have cameras which captures images a particular direction and sends to a backend server where the image is processed and an optimum time limit is returned.
